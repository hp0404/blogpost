Welcome. This site hosts a minimal, clean list of my publications and notes.

- I publish as markdown, with images and code blocks.
- Use the Publications tab to filter by tags or search.

You can tweak the site title and description in `_config.yml`.

This site is a lightweight template, created with GPT-5, so I can focus on writing rather than setup.
